/**
 * A provider for interacting with the TRON blockchain, extending the Web3Provider.
 *
 * `TronWeb3Provider` is designed to integrate TRON's blockchain functionalities with the Web3 interface.
 * It extends the `Web3Provider` class, adapting it to work with the TRON network.
 * This class manages a collection of `TronSigner` instances for transaction signing
 * and provides methods for interacting with the TRON blockchain, such as sending transactions,
 * estimating gas, and retrieving transaction details.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Signer Management: Maintains a collection of `TronSigner` instances for different addresses.
 * - Transaction Handling: Provides methods for sending transactions, estimating gas, and more.
 * - TronWeb Integration: Utilizes TronWeb for direct interactions with the TRON network.
 * - Configurable: Can be configured with custom network settings and HTTP headers.
 *
 * @extends Web3Provider
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {ExternalProvider | JsonRpcFetchFunc} provider - The underlying JSON-RPC provider.
 * @param {HttpNetworkConfig} config - Configuration for the network, including HTTP headers and URL.
 * @param {Networkish | undefined} [network] - The network configuration.
