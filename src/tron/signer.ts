/**
 * Represents a signer for TRON blockchain transactions.
 *
 * `TronSigner` extends the `Wallet` class and integrates with TronWeb to handle TRON-specific
 * transaction signing and interaction. It includes functionality for managing gas prices,
 * energy factors, and other TRON-specific transaction parameters.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - `tronweb`: Instance of TronWeb for interacting with the TRON network.
 * - `gasPrice`: Object to store gas price data with a timestamp.
 * - `energyFactors`: Map to store and manage energy factors for different contracts.
 * - `MAX_ENERGY_FACTOR`: Maximum energy factor, used in calculating transaction fees.
 * - `MAX_ENERGY_DIVISOR`: A workaround divisor for handling BigNumber calculations.
 *
 * @extends Wallet
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} fullHost - The full host URL for the TRON network.
 * @param {Record<string, string>} headers - Headers for network requests.
 * @param {string} privateKey - The private key for the signer.
